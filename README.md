# Maryam Tufail - Senior Frontend Engineer Portfolio
A high-performance, minimalist portfolio built with **Next.js 16**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. Designed for senior engineers who value precision, typography, and clean code.


## ✨ Features

- **Data-Driven**: All content is managed via a central `portfolio.json` file for easy updates.

## 🚀 How to Use (JSON-First Customization)

This portfolio is designed to be **content-agnostic**. You don't need to touch the React code to make it yours.

### 1. Prepare your Data
All content is managed in `/data/portfolio.json`. 

1.  Locate `/data/portfolio.example.json`.
2.  Copy its content into `/data/portfolio.json` (or edit the existing one).
3.  Fill in your own details:
    *   **Profile**: Your contact info, social links, and key metrics.
    *   **Experience**: Your work history as a list of bullet points.
    *   **Skills**: Categorized technical expertise.
    *   **Projects**: Your best work with descriptions and impact metrics.
    *   **Theme**: Customize the hex codes to change the entire site's look and feel.

### 2. Deploy
Once you've updated the JSON, simply push your changes to GitHub and deploy to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any Next.js compatible host.
